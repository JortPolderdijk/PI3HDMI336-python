# PI3HDMI336 Python Library

This is a repository containing a Python library to control the PI3HDMI336 HDMI 3-1 switch IC of Pericom. [See datasheet.](./docs/PI3HDMI336_Datasheet.pdf)
I quickly developed this library for a project, so please don't expect too much from it.  

### Getting started

Make sure you are using `pip >= 7.0`.

`pip install git+https://github.com/JortPolderdijk/PI3HDMI336-python.git --process-dependency-links`

This will install the module.


### Examples

See [demo.py](./examples/demo.py) for an example of reading the PI3HDMI336 3-1 HDMI switch.



Happy switching! ðŸ¤–
